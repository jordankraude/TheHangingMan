# TheHangingMan

In this project, I aimed to create a classic Hangman game to further my understanding of the C++ programming language. As a software engineer, I am continually seeking to expand my knowledge and improve my coding skills. This project allowed me to delve deeper into file handling, loops, and conditional statements in C++. 

The software I wrote is a console-based Hangman game that loads a list of words from an external file, randomly selects one for the player to guess, and provides a visual representation of the hangman as the game progresses. The game tracks the player's correct and incorrect guesses and provides an option to play again after each game.

The purpose of writing this software was to solidify my understanding of C++ basics and explore more advanced topics such as file input/output and dynamic memory management. Additionally, I wanted to create a fun and interactive application that showcases my growing proficiency in C++.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

- **Visual Studio Code**: A powerful, lightweight code editor with a variety of extensions for C++ development.
- **g++ Compiler**: The GNU Compiler Collection for compiling C++ code.
- **CMake**: A tool to manage the build process in a compiler-independent manner.

The programming language used for this project was C++. Additionally, I utilized the standard library for handling strings, vectors, and file input/output operations.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that were helpful during this project:

- [C++ Reference](http://en.cppreference.com): A comprehensive reference for C++ standard library and language features.
- [Learn C++](http://www.learncpp.com): A great resource for tutorials and explanations of C++ concepts and syntax.
- [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com): A community-driven Q&A site where I found answers to specific coding questions and issues.

# Future Work

There are several improvements and additional features I would like to implement in the future:

- Enhance the user interface with a more graphical representation of the hangman.
- Add difficulty levels to the game, offering a selection of word lists based on difficulty.
- Implement a scoring system to track the player's performance over multiple games.
- Add support for different languages by using word lists in other languages.
